# Decentralized Charity Transparency Platform

A blockchain-based transparent charitable giving platform ensuring donations reach intended recipients with comprehensive impact tracking, volunteer coordination, and donor verification.

## Overview

The Decentralized Charity Transparency Platform addresses critical issues in charitable giving through blockchain technology. With Americans donating $470B+ annually and 70% of donors concerned about overhead costs, our platform provides unprecedented transparency and efficiency in charitable operations.
